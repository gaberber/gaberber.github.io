Now I totally see why this is a must-read at M$. Our days and those leading up to the invention of transistors do indeed bare loads of similarities. "They had no idea what they were doing and why things were working." However, the retort I heard before starting to read it also still holds valid: how do you know we're not in the days before the invention of the vacuum tubes? Are you drawing historical lessons from the wrong period of history?

Other parallels with our own times that make for interesting read: Bardeen's frustration re industry vs academia; the politics that accompanied the commercial success; IP protection vs publication; the stimulus on research coming from national security, etc etc. 

But also drastic differences: in those days, the hype effects were achieved by really going out there with a real product made of the new invention whose advantage can be demonstrated live and convincingly within a couple minutes â€” wireless amplification of voice afforded by the small size of solid-state transistors, tolerance to high temperature of silicon, etc. In comparison, how are the showmen today creating the hypes they need?
