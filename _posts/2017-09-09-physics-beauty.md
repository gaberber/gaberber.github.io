随手想到的一个问题：should we really feel surprised at the uncanny beauty of fundamental laws of physics? After all, it's what you asked for: 你非要追问 what is the law that dictates how a single particle (an extreme example of the simplest possible entity and also an abstraction by itself) behaves, 那不就是 you get what you asked for? 你问简单优美（by human standards）的问题，得到简单优美的答案，这真的很奇怪吗？

What's tricky lies not in the answer to the question, but rather the question itself, i.e. how we arrived at that particular question. 

Even high school physics students already realize that the hottest debate is often centered around the formulation of the problem/the steps towards arriving at the mathematical model, and not solving the equation itself.

In that sense, modern (beginning with Newtonian) physics is the most successful in that it excels at asking the right questions that will, naturally, eventually lead to beautiful results.
