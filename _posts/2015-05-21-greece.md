第零讲：我们为什么要了解希腊？为了理解我们今天的社会，为了理解我们自己，为了成为更好的人。

第一讲：史前史。「古典希腊」和迈锡尼、米诺斯等文明的关系。早年的爱琴海地区文明和众多的近东文明非常接近，直到古典希腊起发生了质的变化，使得其成为人类诸古文明中的异数。多利安入侵（即古典希腊的发端）迈锡尼——建立起古典希腊和日耳曼入侵罗马——建立起现代欧洲的过程在许多方面非常类似。

第二、三讲：黑暗时代。东西有点多，没有太记下来，下面这段靠近结尾的稍微整理了一下：

The Greeks are unique among ancient civilizations in that they believe they are of the same race as their deities. Their arrogance. They believe in the greatness of men. 

And yet there's this irreconcilable difference between men and gods: men are mortal. The contrast between the greatness of Man, of living, and the unavoidable eventual fate of death constitutes a central conflict in the Greek mindset, and thus their characteristic idea of life as a tragedy. 

Actually this conflict of the greatness of living and the sadness of death is present in all civilizations, anywhere and any time. There are multiple ways to deal with it, though. The Eastern way to resolve this conflict is to negate the greatness of life: you are nothing from the very beginning and you descend into dust at the end. From dust to dust, there is nothing to be sad of. The Christian way is to negate death: you will not die in utter dismalness and sink into oblivion and nothingness. There is an afterlife that's even better than this life awaiting you in the paradise. 

The Greeks are unique in that they try to negate neither facts. Yes, life is great and death is dismal and unavoidable. However, we bravely face it without flinching. This is where their fundamentally tragic view of the world comes in. This tradition is rooted deeply in the Greek mind ever since Homer. 

How, then, does our modern world answer this fundamental question of life and death? Broadly speaking, we are still in the Age of Enlightenment. We believe in progress. The enlightenment is marked by several trends in ideas: rights (natural rights, or endowed by our creator, personal rights that cannot be infringed upon), individualism, and hedonism. Thus the question of life and death is in effect left to every individual to deal with. No one commands any absolutely correct answer. Everybody believes in whatever he wants to believe. In fact, enlightenment directly leads to nihilism, a typical example of which is Nietzsche and his "superman". Power and self-interest become the dictator of behaviors and beliefs. 

The Greeks would certainly look at the modern moral beliefs with contempt: how can you place individuals above community and personal license above virtues? They will find this "decadence"/"corruption" of values absurd.
