[This episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-history/id1537788786?i=1000518590495) of _The Rest Is History_ podcast on culture wars of the past is a great listen. The many strands with which we can trace the current culture wars back in time include:

- In the narrow sense, the term [Kulturkampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturkampf) was coined by Bismarck.
- In the perhaps broadest sense, a culture war is the eternal struggle between the urban and the agrarian cultures, the people of somewhere and people of nowhere, globalists and country bumpkins. The late Republican turmoils of Rome are a good example.
- Christianity, of course, sets the culture wars we see now apart from more ancient ones. The conversion of the Roman Empire was the beginning of this type of culture wars in the West. Time becomes linear and the idea of "progress" is introduced. The progressivists are no longer simply decadent degenerates, but are the activists leading the way towards the end times, the Rapture. This is the defining character of subsequent culture wars in Europe, the woke vs the ignorant masses.
- The university, ever since they first appeared around the 13th century, has always been a forerunner at instigating culture wars, uprooting knowledge- and experience-seeking youths from the traditions behind them and binding them into a new force. The Albigensian Crusade is an example of such progressivists demolishing the lives of innocent "bigots". This also brings the generational angle into the picture.
- Both sides of the Culture War today are embroiled in what is, in fact, a Christian theological debate, except one party no longer recognizes it. Ironically, they are no less driven by Christian impulses than the so called Christian conservatives. The modern left is on the side that continuously evolved from early Christians down to this day.
