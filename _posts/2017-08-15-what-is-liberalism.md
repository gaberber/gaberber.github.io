[This post (rather confusingly titled *Against Murderism*)](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/) on the Slate Star Codex is a good reminder to us about what liberalism should be in its essence: a delicate means to avoid civil wars. I strongly recommend reading the original post, but for the sake of my own note-taking and making sure everyone that reads this post sees it, I will copy-paste the final paragraphs here.

>   People talk about “liberalism” as if it’s just another word for capitalism, or libertarianism, or vague center-left-Democratic Clintonism. Liberalism is none of these things. Liberalism is a technology for preventing civil war. It was forged in the fires of Hell – the horrors of the endless seventeenth century religious wars. For a hundred years, Europe tore itself apart in some of the most brutal ways imaginable – until finally, from the burning wreckage, we drew forth this amazing piece of [alien machinery](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/). A machine that, when tuned just right, let people live together peacefully *without* doing the “kill people for being Protestant” thing. Popular historical strategies for dealing with differences have included: brutally enforced conformity, brutally efficient genocide, and making sure to keep the alien machine tuned *really really carefully*.

>   The argument goes: liberalism assumes good faith and shared values. It assumes that, at the end of the day, whether you’re Catholic or Protestant, you can still be a basically good person. You can compartmentalize a few special beliefs relating to the Pope, and your remaining differences can be dissolved by the universal solvent of Reason. After everyone does this, you can invoke the wisdom of crowds via a popular election, and even if you don’t like the results you can at least understand where the other side is coming from. Some people prefer liberty to safety, other people prefer safety to liberty, but if the voters choose the wrong one then at least they’ve erred in an understandable way by preferring one real value to another.

>   But if there’s some group out there who aren’t connected to normal human values at all, some group that’s deliberately rejected reason; if they’re willing to throw liberty *and* safety under the bus in pursuit of some kind of dark irrational hatred which is their only terminal goal – then the whole project falls apart. Dialogue based on mutual trust may be all nice and well when it’s supposed to help us choose the optimal balance between liberty and safety, but if you give a platform to the people whose only value is hatred, then they’re just screwing over everybody.

>   And *I agree with this chain of logic*. Using violence to enforce conformity to social norms has always been the historical response. We invented liberalism to try to avoid having to do that, but you can’t liberalism with people who refuse reason and are motivated by hatred. If you give the franchise to green pointy-fanged monsters, they’re just going to vote for the “Barbecue And Eat All Humans” party. If such people existed and made up a substantial portion of the population, liberalism becomes impossible, and we should go back to just using violence to enforce our will on the people who disagree with us. Assuming they don’t cooperate with our strategy of violently suppressing them, that means civil war.

>   I don’t want civil war. I want this country to survive long enough to be killed by something awesome, like AI or some kind of genetically engineered superplague. Right now I think going out in a neat way, being killed by a product of our own genius and intellectual progress – rather than a product of our pettiness and mutual hatreds – is the best we can hope for. And I think this is attainable! I think that we, as a nation and as a species, can make it happen.

>   But it starts with rejecting the “murderism” framework. Rejecting the choice to attribute whatever we disagree with to murderism, *even if it is murderist*, and instead trying to trace it back to root causes that make sense that and humanize the people involved. Working to find the reasons liberalism is possible, rather than the reasons it isn’t. Unless we can do that, semantic confusion and our political polarization are going to build off each other in a vicious cycle into who knows where.

I've noticed something in common among Scott Alexander (author of SSC), Dan Carlin and Mike Duncan: the despair in their tones, the urgent desire to save America yet the clear realization that they are not able to. These three are all well-versed in history as opposed to being ridiculously entrenched in the fads of our own times, stand for clear-headed common sense (as the podcast by Dan Carlin is aptly named) and (especially Scott Alexander) have the good intuition/way of reasoning nurtured by the very tradition that catapulted the West onto the pinnacle of civilizations. They all fear the sheer amount of hate from both sides feeding on each other, breeding a new American civil war that fundamentally transforms this republic into a tumbling empire. They all see this coming yet they can do nothing to stop this. The tone of despair in their voices is truly stifling. 

We can now only look back to the days of an Exceptional America and silently mutter the fateful words, *e pluribus unum*. "Out of many, one."
