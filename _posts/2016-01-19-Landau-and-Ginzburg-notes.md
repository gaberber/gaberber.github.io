# Landau theory

Although we said in the MFA notes that the $m$ in the MFA free energy is not a real parameter but a fixed number under given $T$ and $h$, let us now pretend it is a real _free_ variable as if it can assume any value independent of $T,h$ and treat this $m$ more seriously.

## Landau Hamiltonian


## Critical exponents $\beta,\alpha,\gamma$


# Landau-Ginzburg theory for critical exponents $\eta,\nu$

From Landau to Landau-Ginzburg, we only make one crucial change: $m$ is no longer a global parameter that assumes the same value for the entire lattice, but we now let $m$ vary with $\mathbf{r}$, i.e., _it assumes different values at different places on the lattice_.




# Ginzburg criterion (fluctuation)
