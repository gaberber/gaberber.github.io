> In the greater clash, the global ”real clash,” between Civilization and barbarism, the world’s great civilizations, with their rich accomplishments in religion, art, literature, philosophy, science, technology, morality, and compassion, will also hang together or hang separately.

> When civilizations first emerge, their people are usually vigorous, dynamic, brutal, mobile, and expansionist. They are relatively unCivilized. As the civilization evolves it becomes more settled and develops the techniques and skills that make it more Civilized. As the competition among its constituent elements tapers off and a universal state emerges, the civilization reaches its highest level of Civilization, its “golden age,” with a flowering of morality, art, literature, philosophy, technology, and martial, economic, and political competence. As it goes into decay as a civilization, its level of Civilization also declines until it disappears under the onslaught of a different surging civilization with a lower level of Civilization.

But does e.g. 不得刑讯逼供 belong to the thin layer of morality? It's
hard to achieve without Western separation of powers, which clearly
belongs to the "culture" according to the author himself.\

> a “thin” minimal morality does derive from the common human condition, and “universal dispositions” are found in all cultures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Human society is “universal because it is human, particular because it is a society

> Above, beyond, and growing out of this maximalist morality, however, is a “thin” minimalist morality that embodies “reiterated features of particular thick or maximal moralities.” Minimal moral concepts of truth and justice are found in all thick moralities and cannot be divorced from them. There are also minimal moral “negative injunctions, most likely, rules against murder, deceit, torture, oppression, and tyranny.”


April 9, 2017 00:17

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Cultures are relative; morality is absolute.


April 9, 2017 00:17

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Does the vacuousness of Western universalism and the reality of global cultural diversity lead inevitably and irrevocably to moral and cultural relativism? If universalism legitimates imperialism, does relativism legitimate repression?

> Multiculturalism at home threatens the United States and the West; universalism abroad threatens the West and the world. Both deny the uniqueness of Western culture. The global monoculturalists want to make the world like America. The domestic mulitculturalists want to make America like the world

> What is most plausible and hence most disturbing about this scenario, however, is the cause of war: intervention by the core state of one civilization (the United States) in a dispute between the core state of another civilization (China) and a member state of that civilization (Vietnam).

> They make Western civilization unique, and Western civilization is valuable not because it is universal but because it is unique. The principal responsibility of Western leaders, consequently, is not to attempt to reshape other civilizations in the image of the West, which is beyond their declining power, but to preserve, protect, and renew the unique qualities of Western civilization.


April 8, 2017 21:50

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Europe, as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., has said, is “the source—the unique source” of the “ideas of individual liberty, political democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and cultural freedom. … These are European ideas, not Asian, nor African, nor Middle Eastern ideas, except by adoption.”


April 8, 2017 21:49

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> All civilizations go though similar processes of emergence, rise, and decline. The West differs from other civilizations not in the way it has developed but in the distinctive character of its values and institutions. These include most notably its Christianity, pluralism, individualism, and rule of law, which made it possible for the West to invent modernity, expand throughout the world, and become the envy of other societies.


April 8, 2017 21:48

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> the prudent course for the West is not to attempt to stop the shift in power but to learn to navigate the shallows, endure the miseries, moderate its ventures, and safeguard its culture.


April 8, 2017 21:48

> Imperialism is the necessary logical consequence of universalism


April 8, 2017 21:46

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The belief that non-Western peoples should adopt Western values, institutions, and culture is immoral because of what would be necessary to bring it about.


April 8, 2017 21:46

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> assumption that cultural diversity is a historical curiosity being rapidly eroded by the growth of a common, western-oriented, Anglophone world-culture, shaping our basic values … is simply not tru

That's why liberalism is actually the mirror of Marxism. But what's the
alternative? Cultural relativism?\

> Descriptively it holds that peoples in all societies want to adopt Western values, institutions, and practices. If they seem not to have that desire and to be committed to their own traditional cultures, they are victims of a “false consciousness” comparable to that which Marxists found among proletarians who supported capitalism. Normatively the Western universalist belief posits that people throughout the world should embrace Western values, institutions, and culture because they embody the highest, most enlightened, most liberal, most rational, most modern, and most civilized thinking of humankind.

> T\]he total failure of Marxism … and the dramatic breakup of the Soviet Union,” the Japanese philosopher Takeshi Umehara has suggested, “are only the precursors to the collapse of Western liberalism, the main current of modernity. Far from being the alternative to Marxism and the reigning ideology at the end of history, liberalism will be the next domino to fall

Canada?\

> History shows that no country so constituted can long endure as a coherent society.


April 3, 2017 09:19

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The American multiculturalists similarly reject their country’s cultural heritage. Instead of attempting to identify the United States with another civilization, however, they wish to create a country of many civilizations, which is to say a country not belonging to any civilization and lacking a cultural core.


April 3, 2017 09:19

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The leaders of other countries have, as we have seen, at times attempted to disavow their cultural heritage and shift the identity of their country from one civilization to another. In no case to date have they succeeded and they have instead created schizophrenic torn countries.

April 2, 2017 22:14

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Historically American national identity has been defined culturally by the heritage of Western civilization and politically by the principles of the American Creed on which Americans overwhelmingly agree: liberty, democracy, individualism, equality before the law, constitutionalism, private property. In the late twentieth century both components of American identity have come under concentrated and sustained onslaught from a small but influential number of intellectuals and publicists.

April 2, 2017 19:39

> Immigration, however, was a potential source of new vigor and human capital provided two conditions were met: first, if priority were given to able, qualified, energetic people with the talents and expertise needed by the host country; second, if the new migrants and their children were assimilated into the cultures of the country and the West.

> many things are probable but nothing is inevitable. Civilizations can and have reformed and renewed themselves.


March 30, 2017 20:54

> Decay then leads to the stage of invasion “when the civilization, no longer able to defend itself because it is no longer willing to defend itself, lies wide open to ’barbarian invaders,’ ” who often come from “another, younger, more powerful civilization.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> acute economic depression, declining standards of living, civil wars between the various vested interests, and growing illiteracy. The society grows weaker and weaker. Vain efforts are made to stop the wastage by legislation. But the decline continues. The religious, intellectual, social, and political levels of the society began to lose the allegiance of the masses of the people on a large scale. New religious movements begin to sweep over the society. There is a growing reluctance to fight for the society or even to support it by paying taxes.


March 30, 2017 20:53

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> This happens because the social groups controlling the surplus have a vested interest in using it for “nonproductive but ego-satisfying purposes… which distribute the surpluses to consumption but do not provide more effective methods of production.” People live off their capital and the civilization moves from the stage of the universal state to the stage of decay.


March 30, 2017 20:52

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Civilizations decline when they stop the “application of surplus to new ways of doing things.


March 30, 2017 20:51

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> What happens within a civilization is as crucial to its ability to resist destruction from external sources as it is to holding off decay from within.


March 30, 2017 20:50

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In previous civilizations this phase of blissful golden age with its visions of immortality has ended either dramatically and quickly with the victory of an external society or slowly and equally painfully by internal disintegration


March 30, 2017 20:50

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The West has, in short, become a mature society entering into what future generations, in the recurring pattern of civilizations, will look back to as a “golden age,”


March 30, 2017 20:49

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The West is developing, as was argued in chapter 2, its equivalent of a universal empire in the form of a complex system of confederations, federations, regimes, and other types of cooperative institutions that embody at the civilizational level its commitment to democratic and pluralistic politics.


March 30, 2017 20:48

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> West now appears to be moving out of its phase of conflict.


March 30, 2017 20:47

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Western civilization gradually began to take shape between A.D. 370 and 750 through the mixing of elements of Classical, Semitic, Saracen, and barbarian cultures. Its period of gestation lasting from the middle of the eighth century to the end of the tenth century was followed by movement, unusual among civilizations, back and forth between phases of expansion and phases of conflict.


March 30, 2017 20:46

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: __gestation__

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> the gradual and irregular decline of the West which started in the early twentieth century could continue for decades and perhaps centuries to come. Or the West could go through a period of revival, reverse its declining influence in world affairs, and reconfirm its position as the leader whom other civilizations follow and imitate.


March 30, 2017 20:45

> The development of the West to date has not deviated significantly from the evolutionary patterns common to civilizations throughout history.

Western Universalism has a better argument than any other civilization.
Modernization is something that happened only once in human history, the
influence and significance of which are paralleled by only one event:
the agricultural revolution and the rise of settled civilization.
Modernization = industrial revolution + free market system. Liberal
political order? Not so sure. That might be a distinctively Western
thing. These factors rely on each other to arise out of an agricultural
society. However, after the industrial revolution took place, its
\*results\* (not the process) can be far spread and long preserved even
after the other two (or possibly more) socioeconomic factors are no
longer in place. So yes, the West has had unparalleled impact on
everyone else. Industry and agriculture, if these two are not universal,
I don't know what is. Technology is almost always universal (but not
science). The Industrial revolution originated from the west. The
resulting means of production is universal, but not the Western
civilization (culture, politics etc) itself.\

> The West obviously differs from all other civilizations that have ever existed in that it has had an overwhelming impact on all other civilizations that have existed since 1500. It also inaugurated the processes of modernization and industrialization that have become worldwide, and as a result societies in all other civilizations have been attempting to catch up with the West in wealth and modernity.


March 30, 2017 20:28

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In the past, however, the peoples of other civilizations thought similarly and thought wrong.


March 30, 2017 20:28

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Societies that assume that their history has ended, however, are usually societies whose history is about to decline.


March 30, 2017 10:24

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The same was true at the peak of the Pax Britannica. For the English middle class in 1897, “as they saw it, history for them, was over. … And they had every reason to congratulate themselves on the permanent state of felicity which this ending of history had conferred on them.”


March 30, 2017 10:24

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> History ends at least once and occasionally more often in the history of every civilization. As the civilization’s universal state emerges, its people become blinded by what Toynbee called “the mirage of immortality” and convinced that theirs is the final form of human society. So it was with the Roman Empire, the ’Abbasid Caliphate, the Mughal Empire, and the Ottoman Empire.


March 30, 2017 10:23

> Russia will be a continuing presence in the Transcaucasus and will have the capability to enforce the cease-fire it sponsored so long as it has an interest in doing so.


March 30, 2017 10:20

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Wars with no secondary or tertiary parties are less likely to expand than others but more difficult to bring to a halt, as are wars between groups from civilizations lacking core states


March 30, 2017 10:19

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Fault line wars are ended not by disinterested individuals, groups, or organizations but by interested secondary and tertiary parties who have rallied to the support of their kin and have the capability to negotiate agreements with their counterparts, on the one hand, and to induce their kin to accept those agreements, on the other


March 30, 2017 10:19

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In conflicts between groups from different civilizations, however, there are no disinterested parties.


March 30, 2017 10:18

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Fault line wars are almost never halted by direct negotiations between primary parties alone and only rarely by the mediation of disinterested parties.


March 30, 2017 10:16

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Achieving a temporary pause also requires a second factor: the involvement of nonprimary level participants with the interest and the clout to bring the fighters together


March 30, 2017 10:16

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The first is exhaustion of the primary participants.


March 30, 2017 10:15

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Fault line wars are intermittent; fault line conflicts are interminable.


March 30, 2017 10:15

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Fault line violence may stop entirely for a period of time, but it rarely ends permanently.


March 30, 2017 10:14

> Democrats, communists, and fascists went to Spain to fight alongside their ideological brethren, and democratic, communist, and, most actively, fascist governments provided aid


March 30, 2017 10:14

Because American Exceptionalism! America is a nation with an idea.\

> Why during and after the war was the United States the only country to break the civilizational mold and become the single non-Muslim country promoting the interests of the Bosnian Muslims and working with Muslim countries on their behalf? What explains this American anomaly?


March 30, 2017 10:11

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The one partial exception to this civilizational pattern was the United States, whose leaders rhetorically favored the Muslims.


March 30, 2017 10:11

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In fault line wars, each side has incentives not only to emphasize it own civilizational identity but also that of the other side


March 29, 2017 23:28

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Once the broader Yugoslav identity collapsed, however, these casual religious identities assumed new relevance, and once fighting began they intensified.


March 29, 2017 23:23

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Historically, communal identities in Bosnia had not been strong; Serbs, Croats, and Muslims lived peacefully together as neighbors; intergroup marriages were common; religious identifications were weak.


March 29, 2017 23:23

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In the course of the war, multiple identities fade and the identity most meaningful in relation to the conflict comes to dominate. That identity almost always is defined by religion.


March 29, 2017 23:20

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The victory of the extremists is not necessarily permanent. Extremist violence is no more likely than moderate compromise to end a fault line war. As the costs in death and destruction escalate, with little to show for them, on each side moderates are likely to reappear, again pointing to the “senselessness” of it all and urging another attempt to end it through negotiations.


March 29, 2017 23:20

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Moderates with more limited goals, such as autonomy rather than independence, do not achieve these goals through negotiation, which almost always initially fails, and get supplemented or supplanted by radicals committed to achieving more extreme goals through violence


March 29, 2017 23:18

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> As revolutions evolve, moderates, Girondins, and Mensheviks lose out to radicals, Jacobins, and Bolsheviks.


March 28, 2017 19:04

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> A “hate dynamic” emerges, comparable to the “security dilemma” in international relations, in which mutual fears, distrust, and hatred feed on each other.2 Each side dramatizes and magnifies the distinction between the forces of virtue and the forces of evil and eventually attempts to transform this distinction into the ultimate distinction between the quick and the dead.


March 28, 2017 19:03

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Identities which had previously been multiple and casual become focused and hardened;


March 28, 2017 19:03

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Once started, fault line wars, like other communal conflicts, tend to take on a life of their own and to develop in an action-reaction pattern


March 28, 2017 19:02

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The aging of this pig-in-the-python generation by the third decade of the twenty-first century and economic development in Muslim societies, if and as that occurs, could consequently lead to a significant reduction in Muslim violence propensities and hence to a general decline in the frequency and intensity of fault line wars.


March 28, 2017 08:22

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> this factor alone would go a long way to explaining Muslim violence in the 1980s and 1990s.


March 28, 2017 08:21

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Finally, and most important, the demographic explosion in Muslim societies and the availability of large numbers of often unemployed males between the ages of fifteen and thirty is a natural source of instability and violence both within Islam and against non-Muslims.


March 28, 2017 08:21

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> A more persuasive factor possibly explaining both intra- and extra-Islamic conflict is the absence of one or more core states in Islam.


March 28, 2017 08:21

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The Muslim as victim argument, however, does not explain conflicts between Muslim majorities and non-Muslim minorities in countries such as Sudan, Egypt, Iran, and Indonesia.


March 28, 2017 08:20

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Muslims are, according to this argument, victims of a widespread anti-Muslim prejudice comparable to the anti-Semitism that historically pervaded Western societies.


March 28, 2017 08:20

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Militarism, indigestibility, and proximity to non-Muslim groups are continuing features of Islam and could explain Muslim conflict propensity throughout history, if that is the case. Three other temporally limited factors could contribute to this propensity in the late twentieth century.


March 28, 2017 08:19

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Even more than Christianity, Islam is an absolutist faith. It merges religion and politics and draws a sharp line between those in the Dar al-Islam and those in the Dar al-harb. As a result, Confucians, Buddhists, Hindus, Western Christians, and Orthodox Christians have less difficulty adapting to and living with each other than any one of them has in adapting to and living with Muslims.


March 28, 2017 08:18

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Indigestibility, however, works both ways:


March 28, 2017 08:18

> the “indigestibility” of Muslims.


March 28, 2017 08:18

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Muslim and non-Muslim expansion by land thus resulted in Muslims and non-Muslims living in close physical proximity throughout Eurasia. In contrast, the expansion of the West by sea did not usually lead to Western peoples living in territorial proximity to non-Western peoples: these were either subjected to rule from Europe or, except in South Africa, were virtually decimated by Western settlers.


March 28, 2017 08:17

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> In the wake of the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans urban South Slavs often converted to Islam while rural peasants did not, and thus was born the distinction between Muslim Bosnians and Orthodox Serbs.


March 28, 2017 08:16

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Second, from its origin in Arabia, the spread of Islam across northern Africa and much of the middle East and later to central Asia, the Subcontinent, and the Balkans brought Muslims into direct contact with many different peoples, who were conquered and converted, and the legacy of this process remains.


March 28, 2017 08:16

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Muhammad himself is remembered as a hard fighter and a skillful military commander.”35 (No one would say this about Christ or Buddha.) The doctrines of Islam, it is argued, dictate war against unbelievers, and when the initial expansion of Islam tapered off, Muslim groups, quite contrary to doctrine, then fought among themselves.


March 28, 2017 08:16

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The Koran and other statements of Muslim beliefs contain few prohibitions on violence, and a concept of nonviolence is absent from Muslim doctrine and practice.


March 28, 2017 08:15

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> First, the argument is made that Islam has from the start been a religion of the sword and that it glorifies military virtues.


March 28, 2017 08:14

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Six possible causes suggest themselves. Three explain only violence between Muslims and non-Muslims and three explain both that and intra-Islam violence. Three also explain only the contemporary Muslim propensity to violence, while three others explain that and a historical Muslim propensity, if it exists


March 28, 2017 08:13

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The first fairly contested elections in almost every former Soviet and former Yugoslav republic were won by political leaders appealing to nationalist sentiments and promising vigorous action to defend their nationality against other ethnic groups. Electoral competition encourages nationalist appeals and thus promotes the intensification of fault line conflicts into fault line wars.


March 28, 2017 08:11

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> As the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia began to come apart, the elites in power did not organize national elections. If they had done so, political leaders would have competed for power at the center and might have attempted to develop multiethnic and multicivilizational appeals to the electorate and to put together similar majority coalitions in parliament. Instead, in both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia elections were first organized on a republic basis, which created the irresistible incentive for political leaders to campaign against the center, to appeal to ethnic nationalism, and to promote the independence of their republics.


March 28, 2017 08:10

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The downfall of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia did the same at the end of the Cold War. People could no longer identify as communists, Soviet citizens, or Yugoslavs, and desperately needed to find new identities. They found them in the old standbys of ethnicity and religion.


March 28, 2017 08:08

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires at the end of World War I stimulated ethnic and civilizational conflicts among successor peoples and states. The end of the British, French, and Dutch empires produced similar results after World War II.


March 28, 2017 08:07

> Here and elsewhere politics was also a cause of strife.


March 28, 2017 08:07

> They do not, however, explain all of them. The fighting between Serbs and Croats, for instance, cannot be attributed to demography and, for that matter, only partially to history,


March 28, 2017 08:07

------------------------------------------------------------------------




> Ethnic expansion by one group led to ethnic cleansing by the other. “Why do we kill children?” one Serb fighter asked in 1992 and answered, “Because someday they will grow up and we will have to kill them then.”

Is this what will happen to Western Europe soon?\

> All this aroused Serbian nationalism and Slobodan Milosevic saw his opportunity. In 1987 he delivered a major speech at Kosovo appealing to Serbs to claim their own land and history. “Immediately a great number of Serbs—communist, noncommunist and even anticommunist—started to gather around him, determined not only to protect the Serbian minority in Kosovo, but to suppress the Albanians and turn them into second-class citizens. Milosevic was soon acknowledged as a national leader.”

> These European parties opposing Muslim immigration were in large part the mirror image of Islamist parties in Muslim countries. Both were outsiders denouncing a corrupt establishment and its parties, exploiting economic grievances, particularly unemployment, making ethnic and religious appeals, and attacking foreign influences in their society. In both cases an extremist fringe engaged in acts of terrorism and violence. In most instances both Islamist and European nationalist parties tended to do better in local than in national elections. Muslim and European political establishments responded to these developments in similar fashion. In Muslim countries, as we have seen, governments universally became more Islamic in their orientations, symbols, policies, and practices. In Europe mainstream parties adopted the rhetoric and promoted the measures of the right-wing, anti-immigration parties
