## The life of city states and nations

From ancient Greece and Rome to medieval Venice, Netherlands, Britain and US, we can roughly trace out a well-trodden path. City states/nations emerge as a healthy and strong community after defeating a tough enemy in their youths. Then they flourish in the days immediately after, which are often called their _golden age_, rapidly expanding/colonizing and creating unmatched art and thought. But meanwhile, the wealth accumulated is slowly eroding the solidarity between the elites and commoners. They no longer share common lives as fellow citizens and the tender links between the classes begin to wear out. The expansion together with the erosion of personal ties and trust within the community leads to a massive bureaucracy, which doesn't need to operate on the basis of family, friends and social connections. The bureaucratic institutions are, at least at first, still highly efficient and  mostly just. At this stage the said nation reaches the pinnacle of civilization in their lives. Decline and fall will inevitably start to set in after that. 

Greek golden age: after the Persian wars and before the Peloponnesian War, _i.e._ the overreach of the Athenian empire and also the internal conflict between Greek city states. In the Hellenistic age the Greek civilization reached its farthest limits on the Eurasian continent.

Roman golden age: the republic era, after defeating the despot king Tarquin and before the late Republic civil wars. Imperial Rome is clearly the bureaucratic age, creating the vast majority of the art pieces we see today left from the Antiquity.

Venetian golden age: after the Fourth Crusade and sack of Constantinople and before the Age of Discovery, by which time it has already reached its peak.

Dutch golden age: literally the Golden Age, soon after gaining independence from the Spanish Habsburgs, signified by the establishment of the Dutch East Indian Company (VOC) and Amsterdam Stock exchange. The biggest hit, however, comes not from internal conflict but the Napoleonic wars and conquest. Later WW I & II also does the same. Most of West Europe and North America is in this healthy bureaucratic stage now.

British golden age: after the Glorious Revolution and before WWI. In the Venetian, Dutch and British cases, their expansive colonies (most notably Crete, Indonesia, Middle East and South Asia, respectively) greatly facilitated their fall from top.

American golden age: alas, let's not ponder on this too much.

## Venice vs Genoa

These two are almost mirror images of one another, sitting at almost symmetric geographic locations. The main difference between them is that Genoa is much more fiercely individualistic, while Venetians are a community held very firmly together. Individualism is never a virtue for its own sake. In the case of Genoa it eventually lead to the demise of the city state.
