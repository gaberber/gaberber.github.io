[*City of Fortune: How Venice Won and Lost a Naval Empire*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11006684-city-of-fortune)

## The life of city states and nations

From ancient Greece and Rome to medieval Venice, Netherlands, Britain and US, we can roughly trace out a well-trodden path. City states/nations emerge as a healthy and strong community after defeating a tough enemy in their youths. Then they flourish in the days immediately after, which are often called their _golden age_, rapidly expanding/colonizing and creating unmatched art and thought. But meanwhile, the wealth accumulated is slowly eroding the solidarity between the elites and commoners. They no longer share the sense of a common fate as fellow citizens and the tender links between the classes begin to wear out. The expansion together with the erosion of personal ties and trust within the community leads to the establishment of a massive bureaucracy, which doesn't need to operate on the basis of links between family, friends and other social connections. The bureaucratic institutions are, at least at first, still highly efficient and  mostly just. It's at this stage that the said nation reaches the pinnacle of civilization in their lives. Decline and fall will inevitably start to set in after that. 

Greek golden age: after the Persian wars and before the Peloponnesian War, _i.e._ the overreach of the Athenian empire and also the internal conflict between Greek city states. In the Hellenistic age the Greek civilization reached its farthest limits on the Eurasian continent.

Roman golden age: the Republic era, after defeating the despot king Tarquin and before the late Republic civil wars. Imperial Rome is clearly the bureaucratic age, creating the vast majority of the art pieces we see today left from the Antiquity.

Venetian golden age: after the Fourth Crusade and sack of Constantinople and before the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

Dutch golden age: literally the Golden Age, soon after gaining independence from the Spanish Habsburgs, signified by the world's largest and first publicly traded company, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the world's first stock exchange, Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The biggest hit, however, comes not from internal conflict but the Napoleonic wars and conquest. Later WW I & II also does the same. Most of West Europe and North America is in this healthy bureaucratic stage now.

British golden age: after the Glorious Revolution and before WWI. In the Venetian, Dutch and British cases, their expansive colonies (most notably Crete, Indonesia, Middle East and South Asia, respectively) greatly facilitated their fall from top.

American golden age: alas, let's not ponder on this too much.

## Venice vs Genoa

These two are almost mirror images of one another, sitting at almost symmetric geographic locations. The main difference between them is that Genoa is much more fiercely individualistic, while Venetians are a community held very firmly together. Individualism is never a virtue for its own sake. In the case of Genoa it eventually lead to the demise of the city state. 

## Spengler vs Toynbee

The Spenglerian narrative of history views each nation/people as a living organism and sees its course of "life" as rather analogous to that of a human being. While this view certainly aids us in improving our understanding of what happened in the past thousands of years, the analogy fails miserably at some critical junctures in history. Unlike human beings, nations/peoples can and often do merge with each other and demarcation lines between them are much, much less clear. A most typical example of this is the northern Italian city states after the fall of the Roman Empire. They are neither totally Roman nor barbarian, but the mixed result of both.

Another apparent flaw in the Spengler narrative is that while laws of nature largely determine the condition of a human being at a certain age, that of nations and peoples is to a very large degree shaped by its surrounding environment. Nations don't live in a vacuum on their own. They rise often because of external factors and fall equally often for the same reason. In the case of Venice, its fate is always entwined with that of Constantinople. A lot can be said about the Venice by simply examining its composition of citizens, form of government, way of life and distribution of wealth within the city etc., but we would never grasp the full picture without checking at the same time what is happening in other parts of the world. Generally, the more powerful the military might of a nation is, the more independently it can dictate its own fate.
