The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, The Definitive Edition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

> in Germany it was largely people of good will, men who were admired
 and held up as models in the democratic countries, who prepared the
 way for, if they did not actually create, the forces which now stand
 for everything they detest.


*(3 October 2017 09:51)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


> Few are ready to recognize that the rise of fascism and naziism was
 not a reaction against the socialist trends of the preceding period
 but a necessary outcome of those tendencies.


*(3 October 2017 09:52)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


> eighty years ago John Stuart Mill was writing his great essay On
 Liberty, he drew his inspiration, more than from any other men, from
 two Germans—Goethe and Wilhelm von Humboldt

> but to determine the circumstances which during the last seventy
 years have made possible the progressive growth and the ultimate
 victory of a particular set of ideas, and why in the end this victory
 has brought the most vicious elements among them to the top.


*(3 October 2017 19:46)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: proffered

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> in the wider sense practically all Germans had become socialists and
 that liberalism in the old sense had been driven out by socialism


*(3 October 2017 19:50)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The superficial and misleading view which sees in National Socialism
 merely a reaction fomented by those whose privileges or interests were
 threatened by the advance of socialism


*(3 October 2017 19:50)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the conflict in existence between the National Socialist “Right” and
 the “Left” in Germany is the kind of conflict that will always arise
 between rival socialist factions.


*(3 October 2017 19:51)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> German socialists have found much support in their country from
 certain features of the Prussian tradition


*(3 October 2017 19:52)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> It was the prevalence of socialist views and not Prussianism that
 Germany had in common with Italy and Russia—and it was from the masses
 and not from the classes steeped in the Prussian tradition, and
 favored by it, that National Socialism arose.


*(3 October 2017 19:53)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**One: The Abandoned Road**
Die Zauberflöte

> If the outcome is so different from our aims— if, instead of freedom
 and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it not
 clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we
 are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we
 can resume the road to better things?


*(3 October 2017 19:55)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The crucial point of which our people are still so little aware is,
 however, not merely the magnitude of the changes which have taken
 place during the last generation but the fact that they mean a
 complete change in the direction of the evolution of our ideas and
 social order.


*(3 October 2017 20:18)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> we had progressively been moving away from the basic ideas on which
 Western civilization has been built.


*(3 October 2017 20:19)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> We have progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs
 without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the
 past.


*(3 October 2017 20:23)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> we had been warned by some of the greatest political thinkers of the
 nineteenth century, by Tocqueville and Lord Acton, that socialism
 means slavery


*(3 October 2017 20:23)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the effect of Socialist doctrine on Capitalist society is to produce
 a third thing different from either of its two begetters—to wit, the
 Servile State.


*(3 October 2017 20:24)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> We are rapidly abandoning not the views merely of Cobden and Bright,
 of Adam Smith and Hume, or even of Locke and Milton,5 but one of the
 salient characteristics of Western civilization as it has grown from
 the foundations laid by Christianity and the Greeks and Romans.


*(3 October 2017 20:29)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Not merely nineteenth- and eighteenth-century liberalism, but the
 basic individualism inherited by us from Erasmus and Montaigne, from
 Cicero and Tacitus, Pericles and Thucydides, is progressively
 relinquished.


*(3 October 2017 20:29)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: It was the decisive step in the destruction of that
civilization which modern man had built up from the age of the
Renaissance and which was, above all, an individualist civilization.

Ayn Rand?

> It was the decisive step in the destruction of that civilization
 which modern man had built up from the age of the Renaissance and
 which was, above all, an individualist civilization.


*(3 October 2017 20:31)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Not the Genoaese individualism?

> But the individualism of which we speak in contrast to socialism and
 all other forms of collectivism has no necessary connection with
 these.


*(3 October 2017 20:32)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and
 the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed
 during the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we
 know as Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man
 qua man, that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as
 supreme in his own sphere, however narrowly that may be circumscribed,
 and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own
 individual gifts and bents.


*(5 October 2017 13:40)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Then the word “tolerance” also took on a new meaning.

> *“Freedom” and “liberty” are now words so worn with use and abuse that
 one must hesitate to employ them to express the ideals for which they
 stood during that period. “Tolerance” is, perhaps, the only word which
 still preserves the full meaning of the principle which during the
 whole of this period was in the ascendant and which only in recent
 times has again been in decline, to disappear completely with the rise
 of the totalitarian state.


*(5 October 2017 13:41)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The gradual transformation of a rigidly organized hierarchic system
 into one where men could at least attempt to shape their own life,
 where man gained the opportunity of knowing and choosing between
 different forms of life, is closely associated with the growth of
 commerce.


*(5 October 2017 13:42)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> From the commercial cities of northern Italy the new view of life
 spread with commerce to the west and north, through France and the
 southwest of Germany to the Low Countries and the British Isles,
 taking firm root wherever there was no despotic political power to
 stifle it. In the Low Countries and Britain it for a long time enjoyed
 its fullest development and for the first time had an opportunity to
 grow freely and to become the foundation of the social and political
 life of these countries. And it was from there that in the late
 seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it again began to spread in a
 more fully developed form to the West and East, to the New World and
 to the center of the European continent, where devastating wars and
 political oppression had largely submerged the earlier beginnings of a
 similar growth.


*(6 October 2017 01:12)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The most fateful of these developments, pregnant with consequences
 not yet extinct, was the subjection and partial destruction of the
 German bourgeoisie by the territorial princes in the fifteenth and
 sixteenth centuries.


*(6 October 2017 01:12)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the destruction of the influence of the bourgeoisie in Germany after
 World War I, when hyperinflation wiped out the savings of middle-class
 German bondholders and helped pave the way for Hitler’s rise. The
 extermination of the kulaks as Stalin consolidated his power was
 another analogue


*(6 October 2017 01:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


> During the whole of this modern period of European history the
 general direction of social development was one of freeing the
 individual from the ties which had bound him to the customary or
 prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary activities.


*(6 October 2017 01:22)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


I.e. it’s not a grand policy carries out by libertarians.

> The conscious realization that the spontaneous and uncontrolled
 efforts of individuals were capable of producing a complex order of
 economic activities could come only after this development had made
 some progress. The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in
 favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic
 activity which had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of
 political freedom.


*(6 October 2017 01:23)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the greatest result of the unchaining of individual energies was the
 marvelous growth of science which followed the march of individual
 liberty from Italy to England and beyond.


*(6 October 2017 01:24)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the beliefs of the great majority on what was right and proper were
 allowed to bar the way of the individual innovator.


*(6 October 2017 10:52)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> What the nineteenth century added to the individualism of the
 preceding period was merely to make all classes conscious of freedom,
 to develop systematically and continuously what had grown in a
 haphazard and patchy manner, and to spread it from England and Holland
 over most of the European continent.


*(6 October 2017 10:55)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> We cannot do justice to this astonishing growth if we measure it by
 our present standards, which themselves result from this growth and
 now make many defects obvious.


*(6 October 2017 10:56)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> by the beginning of the twentieth century the workingman in the
 Western world had reached a degree of material comfort, security, and
 personal independence which a hundred years before had seemed scarcely
 possible.


*(6 October 2017 10:57)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> With the success grew ambition


*(6 October 2017 10:57)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a
 stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for
 all.


*(9 October 2017 00:43)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the
 wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of thumb,
 above all the principle of laissez faire.


*(9 October 2017 00:44)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Truly wise

> Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable. Against the
 innumerable interests which could show that particular measures would
 confer immediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they
 caused was much more indirect and difficult to see, nothing short of
 some hard-and-fast rule would have been effective.


*(9 October 2017 00:45)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> a progress which came to be taken more and more for granted and was
 no longer recognized as the result of the policy of freedom.


*(9 October 2017 00:54)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly
 unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now appeared both
 unbearable and unnecessary.


*(9 October 2017 00:55)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the just irritation with those who used liberal phraseology in
 defense of antisocial privileges,


*(9 October 2017 00:55)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The current European liberal mindset

> What had been achieved came to be regarded as a secure and
 imperishable possession, acquired once and for all.


*(10 October 2017 00:57)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> as the hope of the new generation came to be centered on something
 completely new, interest in and understanding of the functioning of
 the existing society rapidly declined


*(10 October 2017 00:59)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the uncritical transfer to the problems of society of habits of
 thought engendered by the preoccupation with technological problems,
 the habits of thought of the natural scientist and the engineer,


*(11 October 2017 22:23)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> how we can make the best use of the spontaneous forces found in a
 free society


*(11 October 2017 22:25)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> this change in the trend of ideas has coincided with a reversal of
 the direction in which ideas have traveled in space


*(11 October 2017 22:27)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> By about 1870 the reign of these ideas had probably reached its
 easternmost expansion. From then onward it began to retreat, and a
 different set of ideas, not really new but very old, began to advance
 from the East.


*(11 October 2017 22:27)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> For the next sixty years Germany became the center from which the
 ideas destined to govern the world in the twentieth century spread
 east and west.


*(11 October 2017 22:27)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Although most of the new ideas, and particularly socialism, did not
 originate in Germany, it was in Germany that they were perfected and
 during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the first quarter of the
 twentieth century that they reached their fullest development.


*(11 October 2017 22:28)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> a generation before socialism became a serious issue in this country,
 Germany had a large socialist party in her parliament


*(11 October 2017 22:29)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The intellectual influence which German thinkers were able to
 exercise during this period on the whole world was supported not
 merely by the great material progress of Germany but even more by the
 extraordinary reputation which German thinkers and scientists had
 earned during the preceding hundred years


*(11 October 2017 22:30)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> But it soon served to assist the spreading from Germany of ideas
 directed against the foundations of that civilization.


*(11 October 2017 22:31)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the common heritage of European civilization became to them, long
 before the Nazis, “Western” civilization—where “Western” was no longer
 used in the old sense of Occident but had come to mean west of the
 Rhine. “Western” in this sense was liberalism and democracy,
 capitalism and individualism, free trade and any form of
 internationalism or love of peace.


*(11 October 2017 22:31)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> their own former convictions had merely been rationalizations of
 selfish interests, that free trade was a doctrine invented to further
 British interests,


*(11 October 2017 22:32)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Two: The Great Utopia**

> It has happened because they were persuaded of the very opposite of
 what these men had predicted.


*(11 October 2017 22:34)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


> quite openly began as a reaction against the liberalism of the French
 Revolution


*(11 October 2017 22:34)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> socialism in its beginnings was frankly authoritarian.


*(11 October 2017 22:34)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Only under the influence of the strong democratic currents preceding
 the revolution of 1848 did socialism begin to ally itself with the
 forces of freedom.


*(12 October 2017 00:30)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> democracy as an essentially individualist institution stood in an
 irreconcilable conflict with socialism


*(12 October 2017 00:30)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word:
 equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in
 liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.


*(12 October 2017 00:31)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> To allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the strongest of
 all political motives—the craving for freedom—socialism began
 increasingly to make use of the promise of a “new freedom.”


*(12 October 2017 00:32)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> To the great apostles of political freedom the word had meant freedom
 from coercion, freedom from the arbitrary power of other men, release
 from the ties which left the individual no choice but obedience to the
 orders of a superior to whom he was attached.


*(12 October 2017 01:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Freedom in this sense is, of course, merely another name for power


*(12 October 2017 01:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vocabulary: niggardliness

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Socialism was embraced by the greater part of the intelligentsia as
 the apparent heir of the liberal tradition


*(12 October 2017 09:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Observer after observer, in spite of the contrary expectation with
 which he approached his subject, has been impressed with the
 extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under
> “fascism” and “communism.”


*(12 October 2017 09:14)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> whether these new tyrannies were not the outcome of the same
 tendencies.


*(12 October 2017 09:14)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an inevitable although
 unforeseen political accompaniment of the nationalization and
 collectivization which he had relied upon as part of his plan for
 erecting a classless society,


*(12 October 2017 09:16)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> socialism is certain to prove, in the beginning at least, the road
 NOT to freedom, but to dictatorship and counter-dictatorships, to
 civil war of the fiercest kind. Socialism achieved and maintained by
 democratic means seems definitely to belong to the world of utopias.


*(12 October 2017 09:17)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion,
 and it has proved as much an illusion in Stalinist Russia as in
 pre-Hitler Germany.


*(19 October 2017 19:55)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently with each
 other than with other parties. They competed for the support of the
 same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the
 heretic


*(19 October 2017 19:57)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Hitlerism proclaims itself as both true democracy and true socialism,
 and the terrible truth is that there is a grain of truth for such
 claims—an infinitesimal grain, to be sure, but at any rate enough to
 serve as a basis for such fantastic distortions.


*(19 October 2017 19:58)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> by the time Hitler came to power, liberalism was to all intents and
 purposes dead in Germany. And it was socialism that had killed it.


*(19 October 2017 20:00)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Is it still true now?

> most socialists here still believe profoundly in the liberal ideal of
 freedom and that they would recoil if they became convinced that the
 realization of their program would mean the destruction of freedom.


*(19 October 2017 20:01)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Three: Individualism and Collectivism**

> But it means also the particular method by which most socialists hope
 to attain these ends


*(20 October 2017 09:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> In this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of
 private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a
 system of “planned economy” in which the entrepreneur working for
 profit is replaced by a central planning body.


*(20 October 2017 09:13)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> they must be achieved, whatever the cost.


*(20 October 2017 09:14)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> to nearly all those to whom socialism is not merely a hope but an
 object of practical politics, the characteristic methods of modern
 socialism are as essential as the ends themselves.


*(20 October 2017 09:14)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about
 means and not about ends


*(20 October 2017 09:14)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything
 which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism.


*(22 October 2017 22:42)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> all the consequences with which we shall be concerned in this book
 follow from the methods of collectivism irrespective of the ends for
 which they are used


*(22 October 2017 22:45)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> socialism is not only by far the most important species of
 collectivism or “planning” but that it is socialism which has
 persuaded liberal-minded people to submit once more to that
 regimentation of economic life which they had overthrown


*(22 October 2017 22:45)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> the holder of coercive power should confine himself in general to
 creating conditions under which the knowledge and initiative of
 individuals are given the best scope so that they can plan most
 successfully; or whether a rational utilization of our resources
 requires central direction and organization of all our activities
 according to some consciously constructed “blueprint.”


*(29 October 2017 11:18)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> It is important not to confuse opposition against this kind of
 planning with a dogmatic laissez faire attitude.


*(29 October 2017 11:19)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> in order that competition should work beneficially, a carefully
 thought-out legal framework is required and that neither the existing
 nor the past legal rules are free from grave defects.


*(29 October 2017 15:08)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> it regards competition as superior not only because it is in most
 circumstances the most efficient method known but even more because it
 is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each
 other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority.


*(30 October 2017 11:05)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> This is not necessarily true, however, of measures merely restricting
 the allowed methods of production, so long as these restrictions
 affect all potential producers equally and are not used as an indirect
 way of controlling prices and quantities.


*(4 November 2017 13:18)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances or to require
 special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require
 certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the
 preservation of competition.


*(4 November 2017 13:19)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> It is regrettable, though not difficult to explain, that in the past
 much less attention has been given to the positive requirements of a
 successful working of the competitive system than to these negative
 points.


*(4 November 2017 13:29)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> It is by no means sufficient that the law should recognize the
 principle of private property and freedom of contract; much depends on
 the precise definition of the right of property as applied to
 different things.


*(5 November 2017 00:00)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Thus neither the provision of signposts on the roads nor, in most
 circumstances, that of the roads themselves can be paid for by every
 individual user.


*(5 November 2017 00:02)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> In such instances we must find some substitute for the regulation by
 the price mechanism.


*(5 November 2017 00:04)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> To create conditions in which competition will be as effective as
 possible, to supplement it where it cannot be made effective, to
 provide the services which, in the words of Adam Smith, “though they
 may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are,
 however, of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the
 expense to any individual or small number of individuals”— these tasks
 provide, indeed, a wide and unquestioned field for state activity


*(5 November 2017 00:06)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just
 do nothing. An effective competitive system needs an intelligently
 designed and continuously adjusted legal framework as much as any
 other. Even the most essential prerequisite of its proper functioning,
 the prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of
 ignorance), provides a great and by no means yet fully accomplished
 object of legislative activity.


*(5 November 2017 00:08)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The task of creating a suitable framework for the beneficial working
 of competition had, however, not yet been carried very far when states
 everywhere turned from it to that of supplanting competition by a
 different and irreconcilable principle.


*(5 November 2017 00:10)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> And although all sorts of interests are now trying to reestablish
 under this flag privileges which the liberal era swept away, it is
 socialist propaganda for planning which has restored to respectability
 among liberal-minded people opposition to competition and which has
 effectively lulled the healthy suspicion which any attempt to smother
 competition used to arouse.


*(5 November 2017 00:11)*

Vocabulary: syndicalist

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> Nothing, indeed, seems at first more plausible, or is more likely to
 appeal to reasonable people, than the idea that our goal must be
 neither the extreme decentralization of free competition nor the
 complete centralization of a single plan but some judicious mixture of
 the two methods. Yet mere common sense proves a treacherous guide in
 this field.

State capitalism in China?

> Both competition and central direction become poor and inefficient
 tools if they are incomplete; they are alternative principles used to
 solve the same problem, and a mixture of the two means that neither
 will really work and that the result will be worse than if either
 system had been consistently relied upon.


*(5 November 2017 11:08)*

> If they were the result of technological developments or a necessary
 product of the evolution of “capitalism,” we should expect them to
 appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system.
 In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth
 century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries,
 the United States and Germany.

> Far from being appropriate only to comparatively simple conditions,
 it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern
 conditions which makes competition the only method by which such
 coordination can be adequately brought about.

> That the division of labor has reached the extent which makes modern
 civilization possible we owe to the fact that it did not have to be
 consciously created but that man tumbled on a method by which the
 division of labor could be extended far beyond the limits within which
 it could have been planned.

> This is the fundamental fact on which the whole philosophy of
 individualism is based. It does not assume, as is often asserted, that
 man is egoistic or selfish or ought to be. It merely starts from the
 indisputable fact that the limits of our powers of imagination make it
 impossible to include in our scale of values more than a sector of the
 needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking, scales
 of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial
 scales of values exist—scales which are inevitably different and often
 inconsistent with each other.

*(26 December 2017 13:16)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> When individuals combine in a joint effort to realize ends they have
 in common, the organizations, like the state, that they form for this
 purpose are given their own system of ends and their own means. But
 any organization thus formed remains one “person” among others, in the
 case of the state much more powerful than any of the others, it is
 true, yet still with its separate and limited sphere in which alone
 its ends are supreme. The limits of this sphere are determined by the
 extent to which the individuals agree on particular ends; and the
 probability that they will agree on a particular course of action
 necessarily decreases as the scope of such action extends.

 arbitrary government.

Important: this assumption requires a certain degree of homogeneity of
the society. Similar to how racial segregation systematically hacks the
fairness of common law trials via the innate bias of the human brain of
the jurors, “equal opportunities” only produces fair results when the
members of society are homogeneous enough. This is also why we have
separate games for male and female athletes in competitive sports.
However, this is only an issue in the context of nation states
prevailing as the sole provider of legal justice. In multiethnic
societies, each community should be allowed to have their own rules of
law and the state only intercede in inter-community affairs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> In Germany and Italy the Nazis and Fascists did, indeed, not have
 much to invent. The usages of the new political movements which
 pervaded all aspects of life had in both countries already been
 introduced by the socialists. The idea of a political party which
 embraces all activities of the individual from the cradle to the
 grave, which claims to guide his views on everything, and which
 delights in making all problems questions of party Weltanschauung, was
 first put into practice by the socialists.

> The character of the problem changes, however, as in the course of
 the progressive advance toward socialism it becomes more and more
 evident to everyone that his income and general position are
 determined by the coercive apparatus of the state, that he can
 maintain or improve his position only as a member of an organized
 group capable of influencing or controlling the state machine in his
 interest.

> Their very success, and their insistence on the acceptance of the

 the industrial workers.

> Socialism counted on a rapid disappearance of the old middle class
 and completely disregarded the rise of a new middle class,


*(13 February 2018 17:28)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The means which the old socialist parties had successfully employed
 to secure the support of one occupational group—the raising of their
 relative economic position—cannot be used to secure the support of
 all. There are bound to arise rival socialist movements that appeal to
 the support of those whose relative position is worsened. There is a
 great deal of truth in the often heard statement that fascism and
 National Socialism are a sort of middle-class socialism— only that in
 Italy and Germany the supporters of these new movements were
 economically hardly a middle class any longer. It was to a large
 extent a revolt of a new underprivileged class against the labor
 aristocracy which the industrial labor movement had created.


*(13 February 2018 17:56)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------



> The conflict between the Fascist or National Socialist and the older
 socialist parties must, indeed, very largely be regarded as the kind
 of conflict which is bound to arise between rival socialist factions.
 There was no difference between them about the question of its being
 the will of the state which should assign to each person his proper
 place in society.

The logic behind the rise of Nazism?

> Labor socialism had grown in a democratic and liberal world, adapting
 its tactics to it and taking over many of the ideals of liberalism.
 Its protagonists still believed that the creation of socialism as such
 would solve all problems. Fascism and National Socialism, on the other
 hand, grew out of the experience of an increasingly regulated
 society’s awakening to the fact that democratic and international
 socialism was aiming at incompatible ideals. Their tactics were
 developed in a world already dominated by socialist policy and the
 problems it creates. They had no illusions about the possibility of a
 democratic solution of problems which require more agreement among
 people than can reasonably be expected. They had no illusions about
 the capacity of reason to decide all the questions of the relative
 importance of the wants of different men or groups which planning
 inevitably raises, or about the formula of equality providing an
 answer. They knew that the strongest group which rallied enough
 supporters in favor of a new hierarchical order of society, and which
 frankly promised privileges to the classes to which it appealed, was
 likely to obtain the support of all those who were disappointed
 because they had been promised equality but found that they had merely
 furthered the interest of a particular class. Above all, they were
 successful because they offered a theory, or Weltanschauung, which
 seemed to justify the privileges they promised to their supporters.

 relative position which one person or group enjoys compared with
 others;

In the days of the rise of capitalism, the old feudal lords also
suffered greatly in this way. They probably also demanded compensation
of some sorts to secure their status against the hanging tides of
history. Three possible reasons why this didn’t threaten the free market
at that time: 1. The new rising power of capitalism is strong. It is
strong enough to offer at least some of the old lords a free ride along
the way, for example if they exchanged their privileges for economic
security (selling aristocratic titles). And it is strong enough to give
rise to a class of nouveau riches that holds equal or more political
powers compared to the falling old class. 2. No government at that time
enjoyed so much power as to determine the economic status of a class of
people by its deliberate action. Therefore appealing to the government
for more intervention wasn’t the most viable choice for the old class if
they want to fight against that trend. 3. More simplistically, the
Western society has simply lost its initiatives.

> That anyone should suffer a great diminution of his income and bitter
 disappointment of all his hopes through no fault of his own, and
 despite hard work and exceptional skill, undoubtedly offends our sense
 of justice. The demands of those who suffer in this way, for state
 interference on their behalf to safeguard their legitimate
 expectations, are certain to receive popular sympathy and support.

> If those whose usefulness is reduced by circumstances which they

 same way were prevented from making an unmerited gain, remuneration
 would soon cease to have any relation to actual usefulness.

> The conflict with which we have to deal is, indeed, a quite

This is the stage when the bureaucratic society is still “healthy”,
because the population will not bear a more unreasonable arrangement.
Later it will degenerate into the dystopia where the powerful is
entitled to choice and bears no risk, while the powerless has no choice
and takes all the risks.

 relieved of both.

> the more security becomes a privilege, and the greater the danger to
 those excluded from it, the higher will security be prized. As the
 number of the privileged increases and the difference between their
 security and the insecurity of the others increases, a completely new

> Some security is essential if freedom is to be preserved, because
 most men are willing to bear the risk which freedom inevitably
 involves only so long as that risk is not too great. But while this is
 a truth of which we must never lose sight, nothing is more fatal than
 the present fashion among intellectual leaders of extolling security
 at the expense of freedom.

> The belief in the community of aims and interests with fellow-men
 seems to presuppose a greater degree of similarity of outlook and
 thought than exists between men merely as human beings. If the other
 members of one’s group cannot all be personally known, they must at
 least be of the same kind as those around us, think and talk in the
 same way and about the same kind of things, in order that we may
 identify ourselves with them. Collectivism on a world scale seems to
 be unthinkable—except in the service of a small ruling élite.
