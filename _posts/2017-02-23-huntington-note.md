## Chapter 7_

Huntington predicted so much of what happened in the Greater West (West + Russian + Islam civilizations) so successfully (9/11, Crimea, Arab Spring, migrant crisis, etc.), but the only region where he was far off track is Hong Kong and Taiwan. They didn't continue to gravitate towards China along a straight path and have begun to form their own national identity somewhat similar to that of Japan: straddling on the fault line between East and West. Western values and Eastern culture both play significant roles. Or better yet, it's easier to understand East Asia in the old (19c and 20c) framework, to compare China to imperial Germany and Japan instead of post-Soviet Russia.

Huntington is a Westerner after all. Although he is right that Islam and China are going to challenge the West, they are not in the same stage of history. The former is better understood in his new theory framework after the cold war, a 21c (but also an ancient) one; the latter in many ways is a continuation of what happened in the broader West from 17c to 20c. That part of the history has ended in the Greater West but not yet in the Far East.

Notes on why "Greater West". This idea of the major 法统's of this world – Charlemagne, Byzantine, Caliph, Huang Di and two lesser ones, Shah and Khan – was formulated by 刘大可. It helps to notice that three out of the four major 法统's in the current world derive from the Roman world order and came to be the three Greater Western civilizations. The Chinese and Japanese civilizations are truly alien to the West compared to the other two.
