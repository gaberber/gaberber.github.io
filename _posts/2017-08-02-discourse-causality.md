## Causality | Probability

[This article](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/86) is an interesting read. 

Starting point: now that we all know "correlation $$\ne$$ causality", can we make any meaningful distinction between the two? That is, if we observe statistically that events A and B are strongly correlated (in mathematical language, $$P(AB)\ne P(A)P(B)$$, is there any way to tell if A is the cause of B, B is the cause of A, or there exists a C that is the common cause of A and B? There's no definitive answer, but we can try to rule out certain possibilities by doing the following.

-   Method 1: observe how things behave under intervention. E.g., if car exhaust is the main cause of bad air quality, we can make air quality worse by increasing the number of cars running. The inverse if not true, i.e. if we deliberately pollute the air by releasing $$\text{SO}_2$$ into it, the number of cars running on the streets will not increase.
-   Method 2: Reichenbach’s common cause principle. This test will tell if a certain C is the common cause of A and B. The article gives a very good example that I'll recount here. Let $$A\equiv \text{a tsunami occurs in Japan}$$, $$B\equiv \text{a tsunami occurs in Chile}$$, $$C \equiv \text{an earthquake occurs in the Pacific basin}$$. Apparently $$A, B$$ are positively correlated but in this case they have a common cause $$C$$. The test _conditional independence_ reveals such a relation:

$$
P(AB)\ne P(A)P(B);\quad \text{but} \quad P(AB|C) = P(A|C)P(B|C)
$$

That is, $$A, B$$ become independent of each other if you condition them both upon $$C$$. 

Everything above has nothing to do with quantum mechanics. However, since probability is a fundamental language used by quantum mechanics, it is not so surprising that people want to translate the ideas above into a quantum form to learn about what can be said about the concept of causality in the quantum world. The area of quantum causality seems to be attracting more attention now among theorists.

## Fareed Zakaria on identity politics and Islam

[This interview of Fareed Zakaria by Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/the-politics-of-emergency) is worth listening to. A few points.

- Why has the political discourse in the West gotten so much worse in recent years? A crucial point is that a stable democracy is built on the foundation of civil debate and compromise/deal making, and the rise of identity politics (forming political alliances according to _who you are_ instead of _what you believe in_) makes compromise impossible. First of all, you are not able to change your identity without too much toil (gender, race, sexual orientation etc.) so the difference is much less fluid than beliefs and you're forced to defend it more emphatically. Second, there is no "middle ground" for compromise. If in a debate on how much to spend on the military, one party wants 1 million dollars and the other wants 2 million, they can simply settle for 1.5 million in the end. If, on the other hand, they debate on whether group A and B are equal, there's no middle ground: either A and B are equal and are entitled to the same rights, or they are not. 
- People often say "Islam/Muslim is not a race", but for 99% of the Muslims in this world, they simply are Muslims because their parents are, not because they've pondered on questions of life and settled eventually on choosing to be believe in Islam. In effect, the identity of being a Muslim is not too different from that of belonging to a certain race in this sense — you don't get to choose. The direct consequence is, if you attack Islam as a whole, that sounds to most Muslims like an attack on _who they are_ instead of just on what theological beliefs they hold. Of course you expect them to punch back.
- The last part of the conversation where he and Sam Harris discusses where they differ is interesting. As Fareed Zakaria himself summarizes, Sam Harris was speaking to a Western (or let's just say, white) audience who's become too unfamiliar with the idea that theology/"what's said in The Book" matters, without regarding too much the actual implications on the Muslim world.
