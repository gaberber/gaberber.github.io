Sohrab est moi.

Theocratic Islamic rule was to Iran and Sohrab as communist China to myself. It was the beginning point from which we start exploring atheism, rationalism and our veneration and misconception of the West. The relatively liberal and individualistic upbringing, the atomization of the Iranian and Chinese intelligentsia, the discomfort at the sexually charged atmosphere of the true West, the suprise at the strong sense of community/conformity in real Western societies, the strong appeal of the existentialists, etc etc.

Of course in many respects we're different, e.g. he was drawn to communism yet George Orwell was the prophet of my high-school years. I came to experience the West and a much later age and past the time of confused puberty. Despite all this, our paths, as do so many others' who grew up aspiring to be the free thinking intellectual in closed, oppressive societies, converge upon Nietzche, Dostoyevsky, Kafka and Camus. 

> There was a certain mood of anxiety or dispair that tied together the existentialist philosophers and the existential-ish novelists and playwrights. All of them grappled with the consequences of "a world divested of meaning".

And I almost forgot: we both came to know America with Northern Utah as the first stop, among all places. The majestic Wasatch Ranges, the Mormons and the football chants and cheerleading. Alas.
