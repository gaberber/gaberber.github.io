Now it's clear to me: Spain is distinctively a frontier of Christendom, geographically situated like the Baltic or Balkan countries. It's one of the most hard-fought frontline between religions, cultures and ethnicities. This is why in many ways it exhibits some of the most quintessential of its constituent cultures, especially Christianity. Its absolutist monarchy, as opposed to the French, devoted a stunning amount of wealth to the glorification of the Christian church. It tried very hard to declare its European-ness by building magnificent Gothic churches after the heydays of Gothic architecture had passed in the rest of Europe. It promoted a high culture that aspired in every possible way to assert its European/Christian character and purge from its image any residue of the Moorish culture. The result was splendid indeed. However, it couldn't turn the whole society around. The Muslim past held on in the daily lives of the lower class. Flamenco music and dance are unmistakably Middle Eastern. The Jews, despite their partial conversion to Christianity, had to be persecuted (cf the Inquisition) and eventually purged from the entire Iberian peninsula. When a monarch wanted to appeal to the common Sevillianos to form an alliance against the aristocrats, the staunch promoters and defendants of Christian culture, he built an Islamic palace, the Alcazar ("Al", of course, is the article in Arabic and "cazar" comes from an Arabic word that ultimately traces its origin to the Latin word for "castle").

第一次去 Met Museum 最大感受是 原來 古典希臘羅馬清楚無疑是古代東地中海文明的繼承人。這次來 Andalucía 清楚確認 伊斯蘭是羅馬-拜占庭 的後代。
