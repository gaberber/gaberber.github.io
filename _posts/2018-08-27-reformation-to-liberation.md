最近一直为基督教的历史观，那种横扫一切的气势着迷，在 [How (Not) to Be Secular](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18250837-how-not-to-be-secular) 这里看到一个新的大手笔：从 1517 到 1968，整个现代史不过是同一场神学内部运动、一个节拍的起和落。天主教世界里有着「神圣 vs 世俗」的张力，中世纪社会是 inhabit 这种张力（时间上，平日是 structure，carnivals 是 anti-structure，以解构释放积累的压力；空间上，神圣与世俗 vocation 的分别是整个社会作为一个整体，不同部分的分工），而现代性则对这种妥协状态不满，要 resolve 这个冲突（用现在的话说就是「原教旨」化，纯洁化）。这是一种 simplification，正和欧洲政治的现代化如出一辙，也是对中世纪复杂秩序的简单化、极端化。新教改革试图通过把世俗生活神圣化来拉平张力的两端，但这给反方向的另一种 leveling，也就是 exclusive humanism、对「神圣」的彻底拒斥清除了障碍，为彻底的世俗化打开了大门。这个节拍一起一落的运行，走了五百年，西方社会 from dawn to decadence，我们到 20 世纪下半叶才终于看到下半篇章的全面铺开。

Another grand narrative: reformation (including Reformation) leads to the present world of immanence via a zigzag path. Two “zigs”: 1) the interest in the natural world, *e.g.* the late medieval/early renaissance interest in anatomy and perspective painting, and 2) nominalism, *i.e.* things go through motion not because of their “essence” but a chain of causes and effects set in place by God’s hand and then left to their own. We observe and reveal empirically the pattern of their motion and distill the rules of cause and effect, instead of digging deep to discover their “final purpose”/*telos*. This is the foundation of the scientific method. 

By themselves, they point *not* toward disenchantment but devotion to God. The interest in nature, placed in my current context of understanding, is the opposite of Gnosticism – it emphasizes particularity/incarnation/beings themselves, rather than the abstract principles behind and revealed through them. As to nominalism, it seems this opens the door to Deism, which, even today, is the most efficient framework to comprehend theoretical physics and mathematics within. 

However, when these two zigs combined, they turned into a zag that pointed to completely the opposite direction, away from devotion. Together with the other shifts in our frameworks of understanding, they unleash the modern world. 

Nominalism, Taylor suggests, is also responsible for modern totalitarianism. The scientific method, when adopted in the realm of the human society, becomes a kind of statecraft that seeks to manipulate the state of affairs in much the same way as scientists elicit responses through the rules of causes and effects. 

There’s way too much in just this one chapter to jot down. All in all, an over-simplification of these nuances would be to say that modernization is a process of *thawing* of the society. In Taylor’s words, it dis-embeds individuals from the society, society from the cosmos and cosmos/universe from the divine. This, of course, sounds Spenglerian and is illustrated in a chart in Murray’s *Human Accomplishment*.
