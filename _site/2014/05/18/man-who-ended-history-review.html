    <p>At first glance this story seems a bit jumbled and fragmented, constantly switching views and grounds of statements, making you wonder what the author is actually trying to say, or is it just puzzling pieces piled together to form a Rashomon. Wait till you see the end. Here are just a few thoughts in reaction to the questioned asked by this story.</p>

<p>As a Chinese who grew up hearing about the atrocities the Japanese invaders conducted in the War, the name “Unit 731” was, to me, merely that – a name, attached with some cold, objective description, e.g. “biological weapons”, and “vivisection” at most. Yes, I have known from various sources that Unit 731 carried out horrifying deeds on people alive, but none of those matter-of-fact statements really echoed within me an awful lot. However, reading this, a “science fiction”, evoked a much stronger emotion in myself than reading history books, because it is descriptive. It makes you substitute yourself in for the characters and empathize. This raises one of the main questions discussed in this novella to me: has history been, and should it be, an “objective” statement of the things that had happened before? Or should we acknowledge the fact that personal experiences and emotions have always played a great part in shaping the way history is presented to us today, and that this subjective perspective should not be discredited and discarded in the future entirely? Questions like this that appear in the story may sound like those asked by professors in history classes to their freshmen students, but they are worth pondering by the general readers.</p>

<p>I always remember the first time I saw a WWII memorial outside China, in a small town in Australia, which stirred emotions in me even more than when I visited the War Against Japan, as we call it, memorials in China. I have certainly much closer bonds to the Chinese people that fought and died in the War than those Australians, but the reason behind this, observed from the American point of view by the author, is that neither China or Japan indeed treated that part of history compassionately enough. We both chose to forget. Individual lives and experiences were buried deep down beneath those of the states, giving rise to a grand narrative focused entirely on the rise and fall of the nations rather than on history itself and individuals that experienced it. What does “historical truth” even mean? The Eastern approach to history has always been less personal and emphasizes more on a “holistic” view, but has this granted us more insight into the past? The past does not tell us anything as to how we should act today. We humans do. “History is a docile little girl. Dress her however you want to.” This saying is all too famous in Chinese. Ignoring the personal side of history might hinder empathy by successors, eventually opening the door to manipulation and wanton interpretation, and shutting the door to objectivity.</p>

<p>Well, this is not exactly a book review, but a personal document of my own feelings and thoughts. But again, it might not be that useless after all.</p>
