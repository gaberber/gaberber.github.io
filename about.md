I am a senior undergraduate at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China studying microelctronics. I write in Chinese, mostly.

I am currently applying for graduate schools in the US and aiming at a PhD career in applied physics. I wanted to put my CV here to give this site a pro-ish look and make myself sound real fancy but it is totally irrelevant to what I intend to write about, so let's just save the trouble.
